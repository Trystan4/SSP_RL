# SSP_RL

This is a repository is related to the SSP problem and its resolutions through the use of RL algorithms.

The goal is to create a simple GYM environment implementing several algorithms, which can be controlled and compared


## GymEnvironment

First GridWorld environment. Reproduce Gym Env for a 4x4 GridWorld

Add Qlearning algorithm, display Q-Table and mean reward.

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/Trystan4/SSP_RL.git
cd SSP_RL
py main.py
```
